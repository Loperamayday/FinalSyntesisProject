<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<div id="analysis2Plot1"></div>
<p id="analysis2Eqn1" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>Analysis about the observed behavior</h5>
<ul>
  <p>
    The analysis of the graph shows a decrease in electricity consumption in the
    last 5 months of the public services bill. An inverse relationship between
    variable x (months) and variable y (consumed KWh) can be clearly observed.
    This indicates that as the months increase, the consumed KWh decreases.
    Additionally, it can be appreciated that the graph has a negative slope,
    reinforcing the idea that electricity consumption is decreasing as time
    passes. <br />
    Examining the data, the first month shows the highest electricity
    consumption with 231 KWh consumed. For the following month, there is a
    reduction of 37 KWh compared to the previous month, indicating a significant
    decrease in electricity consumption in a short period of time. Although
    there is an increase in electricity consumption in the third month, it is
    only 8 KWh, which is considered insignificant in the context of the
    analysis. In the fourth month, there was another reduction in electricity
    consumption, although not as large as in the second month, suggesting that
    the decrease in electricity consumption is stabilizing. Finally, in the
    fifth month, there was only an increase of 1 KWh, indicating that
    electricity consumption has remained stable. <br />

  <h5>
    Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month.
  </h5>

  <p>
    $$ y=-6.00 \cdot 6 + 222.80 $$ $$ y=186.80 \text{ kWh} $$
  </p>
  <h5>
    conclusion
  </h5>
  <p>
    In summary, the graph shows a downward trend in electricity consumption over
    the past 5 months. This analysis is important to identify possible
    energy-saving measures and cost reduction in the household. Additionally, it
    is important to continue monitoring electricity consumption to identify
    possible fluctuations and take preventive measures since although
    consumption decreases and reaches stability in the last two months,
    consumption cannot be neglected as it could affect the achieved stability.

<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis2Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis2Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <li>
    Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$
    people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  <p>$$ y=31.06 \cdot 200 + 46.12 $$ $$ y= 6258.12 \text{kWh}$$</p>

  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
    between these two variables.
  </li>
</ul>
