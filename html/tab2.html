<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>
  This second part of the project must be done individual. For each plot, you
  must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your
  information is true.

<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>

<ul>
  <p>
    The presented graph shows a significant increase in electricity consumption
    over a period of 5 months in the public services bill. It is important to
    note that a direct relationship between variable x (months) and variable y
    (consumed KWh) can be observed, indicating that as the months go by, the
    consumed KWh increase. In addition, it can be noted that the graph has a
    positive slope, suggesting a constant increase in electricity consumption.
    <br />
    When analyzing the data for each month individually, it can be observed that
    the beginning of the period shows a consumption of 126KWh in electricity. In
    the second month, although not as significant, a considerable increase in
    electricity consumption is presented with an increase of 10KWh compared to
    the first month. For the third month, the consumption decreases to the same
    amount as in the first month, being 126KWh. For the fourth month, the KWh
    consumption remains constant and finally, in the fifth month, a considerable
    increase in electricity consumption is presented, with an increase of 11KWh,
    reaching up to 137KWh.

  <h5>
    Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month
  </h5>
  <p>
    $$ y= 1.20 \cdot 6 + 126.60 $$ $$ y= 133.8 \text{ kWh} $$

<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <li>
    Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$
    people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
    between these two variables.
  </li>
</ul>
