<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  In this part you are going to work as a group to find information about the
  main concepts of this project

  <h5>Electric energy</h5>
  <p>
    is the energy derived from electric potential energy or kinetic energy of
    the charged particles. In general, it is referred to as the energy that has
    been converted from electric potential energy. <br />
    <br />
    The basic unit of electrical energy is the joule or watt-second. An
    electrical energy is said to be one joule when one ampere of current flows
    through the circuit for a second when the potential difference of one volt
    is applied across it. The commercial unit of electrical energy is the
    kilowatt-hour (kWh) which is also known as the Board of trade unit
    (B.O.T).<br />
    <br />
    1 kwh = 1000 × 60 × 60 watt – second <br />
    1 kwh = 36 × 105 Ws or Joules <br />
    Generally, one kwh is called one unit. <br />

  <h5>Watt (physical unit)</h5>
  <p>
    Unit of power in the International System of Units (SI) equal to one joule
    of work performed per second, or to 1/746 horsepower. An equivalent is the
    power dissipated in an electrical conductor carrying one ampere current
    between points at one volt potential difference. It is named in honour of
    James Watt, British engineer and inventor. One thousand watts equal one
    kilowatt. Most electrical devices are rated in watts. <br />
    The Watt commonly indicated by the sign 'W'. <br />
    The basic unit of 1 watt is equivalent to 1 J/s. <br />

  <h5>Scatter plot</h5>
  <p>
    Are the graphs that present the relationship between two variables in a
    data-set. It represents data points on a two-dimensional plane or on a
    Cartesian system.
  </p>
  <p>
    overplotting:When we have lots of data points to plot, this can run into the
    issue of overplotting. Overplotting is the case where data points overlap to
    a degree where we have difficulty seeing relationships between points and
    variables.
